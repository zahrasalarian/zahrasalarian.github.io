Currently an undergraduate student of Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). Highly interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, particularly in realms of Compter Vision, Image Processing, AI for Medicine, Deep Learning. Some related projects to these fields and many more can be find on my GitHub account. 


***[Internships]***

***[AIMedic experience:]***

**AI mini projects**

In 2021’s summer, I spent my summer internship at [AIMedic] (https://aimedic.co), an AI-based company that works in the medical field. Throughout the first phase of the training, I learned about the basics of machine learning and the principles of model building. The syllabus included regression, convolutional neural networks, semantic segmentation, and how to work with relevant frameworks such as Keras and TensorFlow. Assignments regrading these subjects were assigned to the trainees in the form of mini-projects. You can view full source code [here] (https://github.com/zahrasalarian/AI-Mini-Projects).

**EEG signal** 

During the following phase of the internship after selecting some top trainees, working in a team, I developed a PyTorch-based program that employs EEG signals to predict epileptic seizures. It was a valuable experience as it helped me improve my team-working skills and put me into situations in which I was more accountable. Managing time to keep up with the team members, completing tasks that’s been assigned to me during a sprint; and presenting the results to the whole team and scrum master were some ofthe most invaluable soft skills that I gained from this phase of the internship.

**Mammography**

After that, top trainees were hired. I got into the Mammography team to boost my proficiency in image processing. During the time that I was part of the team, I worked on different formats of breast images such as DICOM using various preprocessing technics and employed some convolutional neural networks such as VGG-16 and LSTM to get passable numbers for precision and recall on automatic breast cancer detection.

***[Metodata experience:]***

Visualizing network graph

At the time I was a trainee at [Metodata] (http://metodata.ai), a Data Science company, I worked with a huge amount of data gathered from twitter. Tasks assigned to me were of two types; first extracting several information such as most mentioned sites in the tweets, most frequent unigram and bigram collocations in the tweets and most mentioned and retweeted accounts ranking. The other task was to figure the relations between accounts (based on how much they retweeted and mentioned eachother) and plot the graph of their connections using [Gephi] (https://gephi.org) to make it easier to comprehend the extracted information.

***[Hesaba experience:]***

At the begining of my interest in AI, I enrolled in an internship program offered by [Hesaba] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/hesaba/), a data-driven company. During this internship, I gained experience in analyzing different datasets such as Covid-19 data from Johns Hopkins University, records of football matches, and classical literature. I also practiced writing visual reports in Markdown format and for the final project, trained a model for homicide vs. suicide classification using the H2O platform.
