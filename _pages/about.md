I am Currently an undergraduate student of Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). I am Highly interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the realms of Computer Vision, Image Processing, AI for Medicine, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning; some related projects to these subjects and a few more fields can be found on my GitHub account.  

# Research and Development Experiences

**AIMedic experience:**

* **AI mini projects** <br/>
In 2021â€™s summer, I spent my summer internship at [AIMedic](https://aimedic.co), an AI-based company that works in the medical field. Throughout the first phase of the training, I learned about the basics of machine learning and the principles of model building. The syllabus included regression, convolutional neural networks, semantic segmentation, and how to work with relevant frameworks such as Keras and TensorFlow. Assignments regarding these subjects were given to the trainees as mini-projects. You can view the complete source code [here](https://github.com/zahrasalarian/AI-Mini-Projects).

* **EEG signal** <br/>
The following internship phase started after selecting some top trainees. I joined the signal processing team and worked on developing a PyTorch-based program that employs EEG signals to predict epileptic seizures. It was a valuable experience as it helped me improve my team-working skills and put me into situations in which I was more accountable. Managing time to keep up with the team members, completing tasks assigned to me during a sprint, and presenting the results to the whole team and scrum master, were some of the most invaluable soft skills I gained from this internship phase.

* **Mammography** 
After that, top trainees got hired as artificial intelligence developers. I got into the Mammography team to boost my proficiency in image processing. As a team member, my tasks mainly consisted of two parts; first, searching for different datasets of breast images, including various formats such as DICOM and related papers on how to preprocess and train a model on them. Second, employing the mentioned preprocessing technics and training the convolutional neural networks such as VGG-16 and LSTM, using those images, to get adequate numbers for precision and recall on automatic breast cancer detection.

* **Metodata experience:** <br/>

* **Visualizing network graph**

When I was a trainee at [Metodata](http://metodata.ai), a Data Science company, I worked with a massive amount of data gathered from Twitter. Tasks assigned to me were of two types: extracting detailed information about things such as most mentioned sites in the tweets, most frequent unigram and bigram collocations in the tweets, and most mentioned and retweeted accounts ranking. The other task was to figure out the relations between accounts (based on how much they retweeted and mentioned each other) and plot the graph of their connections using [Gephi](https://gephi.org) to make it easier to comprehend the extracted information.

* **Hesaba experience:** <br/>

At the beginning of my interest in AI, I enrolled in an internship program offered by [Hesaba](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hesaba/), a data-driven company. During this internship, I gained experience analyzing different datasets such as Covid-19 data from Johns Hopkins University, records of football matches, and classical literature. I also practiced writing visual reports in Markdown format, and for the final project, I trained a model for homicide vs. suicide classification using the H2O platform.
